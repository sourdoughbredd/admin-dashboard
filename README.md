# Admin Dashboard

A simple and responsive admin dashboard interface built with HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a responsive admin dashboard built with HTML and CSS. It features a sidebar with navigation links, a header with search and user actions, and a main content area with a welcome message and a responsive card layout built with CSS grid. Note that this is a single page, so the interactive elements will not perform any actions.
